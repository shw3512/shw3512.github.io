# CCNA

- Certification: Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)
- Vendor: Cisco
- Status: Passed (2025-05-20)

## Learning resources

N.B. Cisco announced "[minor updates](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/ccna-exam-topics)" for the CCNA certification, effective 20 August 2024. When you investigate learning resources---for the CCNA or any other exam---I suggest verifying when the resource was created or last updated, and the version of the exam on which it focuses. An older resource isn't worthless, and indeed may be preferred, for reasons of convenience, cost, or curiosity; but in choosing your resources, it helps to know the current exam topics (typically easy to determine) and what has changed regarding exam topics, technology, and best practices (typically harder to determine).

Below I list the resources I used to prepare for the CCNA certification exam.

### Video courses

N.B. Udemy has frequent promotions (sales), so I've never paid the sticker price for a course, which can be over 100 USD. I've seen some users recommend that you directly contact the instructor of the course and ask for a discount. (For example, see [this thread on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Udemy/comments/1fvt036/how_do_discounts_work_how_to_get_one/).) I've not yet tried the latter approach; to date, Udemy's promotions have been frequent and inclusive enough for my wishes.
