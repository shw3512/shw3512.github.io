# CCNA

- Certification: Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)
- Vendor: Cisco
- My certification status: Passed (2025-05-20)



## Learning resources

N.B. Cisco announced "[minor updates](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/ccna-exam-topics)" for the CCNA certification, effective 20 August 2024. When you investigate learning resources---for the CCNA or any other exam---I suggest that you verify when the resource was created and last updated, and the version of the exam on which it focuses. Older resource aren't worthless, and indeed may be preferred, for reasons of convenience, cost, or curiosity; but in choosing your resources, it helps to know what the current exam topics are (typically easy to determine) and what has changed regarding exam topics, technology, and best practices (typically harder to determine).

Below I list the resources that I used to prepare for the CCNA certification exam.

### Books

#### Todd Lammle's two-volume CCNA certification study guide

- Author: Todd Lammle
- Publisher: Sybex
- Editions:
    - 2019 and 2020 (these are the books that I used)
        - Volume 1: "Understanding Cisco networking technologies" ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Cisco-Networking-Technologies-Certification/dp/1119659027))
        - Volume 2: "CCNA certification study guide" ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/CCNA-Certification-Study-Guide-200-301/dp/1119659183))
    - November 2024
        - Volume 1 ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/CCNA-Certification-Study-Guide-Exam-dp-1394213018/dp/1394213018))
        - Volume 2 ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/CCNA-Certification-Study-Guide-200-301-dp-1394302150/dp/1394302150))
- Cost: I purchased a print version of the 2019/2020-edition two-volume set for just over 30 USD from a third-party seller on Amazon in October 2023. As of September 2025, sellers on Amazon offer each volume for less than 10 USD (includes shipping).
- My review: Neutral
    - I read volume 1 only, not volume 2. (When I finished volume 1, I started reading Jeremy McDowell's books, listed below.) Also, I read an older (2019/2020) edition; I do not know how the newer edition compares. I found Todd Lammle's writing to be accessible (to a network beginner) and engaging. Some topics---like banners, configuration registers, licensing, RIP, and several WAN topics---that he covers may be more relevant to on-the-job work (well, maybe not RIP...) than to the current CCNA exam.

#### Jeremy McDowell's two-volume study guide, "Acing the CCNA exam"

- Author: Jeremy McDowell
- Publisher: Manning
- Edition: July 2024
    - Volume 1, "Fundamentals and protocols" ([Manning](https://www.manning.com/books/acing-the-ccna-exam-fundamentals-and-protocols))
    - Volume 2, "Advanced networking and security" ([Manning](https://www.manning.com/books/acing-the-ccna-exam-advanced-networking-and-security))
    - Published in July 2024, the two books together cover all topics on Cisco's "[CCNA exam topics](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/ccna-exam-topics)" list released in August 2024
- Cost: I purchased the print (includes e-book access) version of each volume for 27.49 USD (each), plus 11 USD shipping (total), from Manning in July 2024.
- My review: Highly recommend
    - I found Jeremy McDowell's writing to be accessible (to a network beginner), clear, and logically and effectively organized. McDowell goes into more detail than is needed for the CCNA exam. I don't view this as a negative: McDowell's books provide both an effective framework and helpful context for the CCNA exam topics. This over-prepares you for the CCNA exam, jump-starts you on your CCNP Enterprise studies, and serves you well on the job.



### Video courses

N.B. Some libraries, including public libraries, offer access to Udemy courses. See [Gale Presents: Udemy](https://www.gale.com/product-catalog/16550938), view the e-resources on the website of your library, or ask your librarian. If you pay for a course on Udemy, then note that Udemy has frequent promotions (sales). I've never paid the sticker price for a course, which can be over 100 USD. I've seen some users recommend that you directly contact the instructor of the course and ask for a discount. (For example, see [this thread on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Udemy/comments/1fvt036/how_do_discounts_work_how_to_get_one/).) I've not yet tried this approach; to date, Udemy's promotions have been frequent and inclusive enough for my wishes. Udemy discusses its [instructor promotional agreements and Udemy Deals Program here](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229232827-Instructor-Promotional-Agreements-and-Udemy-Deals?).

- Details:
    - "A free* and complete CCNA course"
        - Free when viewed on YouTube
    - Includes lecture videos (with quizzes at the end of each), lab videos, and instructions for how to get (free) labs (in Packet Tracer) and flashcards (in Anki)
- Review: Highly recommend
    - I found Jeremy McDowell's videos to be highly accessible (to a network beginner), clear, and well organized. As he does in his CCNA books, McDowell in his CCNA videos goes into more detail than is needed for the CCNA exam. I loved his consistent video format: overview, content, review, quiz questions. Most lecture videos have an accompanying lab and lab walk-through video that promote hands-on practice with the lecture material in a simulated network (in Packet Tracer). McDowell's package of videos, flashcards, and labs are highly effective exam preparation.

#### Neil Anderson's "Cisco CCNA 200-301"

- Instructor: Neil Anderson
- Platforms:
    - [FlackBox](https://www.flackbox.com/cisco-ccna-course)
        - Other websites (for example, [Practical Networking](https://www.practicalnetworking.net/announcement/discounted-ccna-course-by-neil-anderson/)) may offer discounts for this course.
    - [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ccna-complete)
- Cost: I purchased the course on Udemy for 16.99 USD in June 2024.
- Details:
    - Includes lecture videos, labs (in Packet Tracer), and flashcards (in Anki)
- Review: Highly recommend
    - I found Neil Anderson's videos to be accessible (to a network beginner), clear, and efficient. The coverage and depth of content in Anderson's videos seem well aligned with the expectations of the CCNA exam. At the time I went through the video courses, Anderson hadn't integrated the labs with the course as tightly as McDowell had: whereas McDowell has a video walk-through of each lab, Anderson provides detailed pdfs (exercises/questions and answers) and text configuration files for each lab. I found the latter harder (but not hard) to use. Anderson came across to me as a knowledgeable, experienced, committed, and well intentioned mentor---exactly the kind of person I want helping me through certification and career-building.
