# Preface

Author's goals with this book:

- "This [book] is what I would have written to my past self in order to prepare him for the real world" (xvii).
- Share insight from his sweat and experience to lower the barrier to entry for others
    - "Thank you, really a great explanation that probably saved me hours of trying to understand that paper" (xvi).

Author's approach:

- Write article on target topic
- Aggregate articles into book
- (Presumably) A sh*t ton of editing
