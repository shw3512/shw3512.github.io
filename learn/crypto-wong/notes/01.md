# Introduction

- Preliminary definitions
    - A **protocol** is a sequence of steps.
    - A **(cryptographic) primitive** (aka **cryptographic algorithm**) is a minimal building block in cryptography.
    - One combines primitives to make protocols.
- Security through obscurity versus Kerckhoffs' principle
    - **Security through obscurity** refers to relying on your adversaries not (yet) knowing about your security measures.
    - **Kerckhoffs's principle** asserts that a cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about it except its key(s) is public knowledge.
        - In this view, secrecy of the key(s), not secrecy of the algorithm, yields security.
    - Modern cryptography favors open algorithms.
- Cryptographers versus cryptanalysts
    - Cryptographers try to build cryptosystems.
    - Cryptanalysts try to break cryptosystems.
- Symmetric cryptography versus asymmetric cryptography
    - **Symmetric cryptography** (aka **secret-key cryptography**) is the set of cryptographic primitives whose functions use the same key.
        - The **key-distribution problem** refers to the challenge that to use a shared key (for example, as required by symmetric encryption), participants must first (securely) share it among themselves.
    - **Asymmetric cryptography** imposes different views on different participants, often by giving different participants different access to different keys (for example, public--private key pairs).
- Asymmetric cryptography
    - Key exchange
        - Diffie--Hellman (DH) algorithm
    - Asymmetric encryption
        - Rivest--Shamir--Adleman (RSA) algorithm
- RSA algorithm
    - Contains two primitives:
        - Asymmetric encryption
            - Each participant has a public--private key pair.
            - Anyone can encrypt using anyone (else's) public key.
              ```
                            Key_public
                                 |
                                 v
                            +---------+
              Plaintext --> | ENCRYPT | --> Ciphertext
                            +---------+
              ```
            - Only the private key can decrypt messages encrypted using the paired public key.
              ```
                             Key_private
                                  |
                                  v
                             +---------+
              Ciphertext --> | DECRYPT | --> Plaintext
                             +---------+
              ```
        - Digital signature
            - A participant uses her private key to generate a signature for a given document.
              ```
                          Key_private
                              |
                              v
                           +------+
              Document --> | SIGN | --> Signature
                           +------+
              ```
            - Anyone can verify the signature by using the signer's public key.
              ```
                                         Key_public
                                             |
                                             v
                                         +--------+
              (Document, Signature)  --> | VERIFY | --> { True | False }
                                         +--------+
              ```

- Attacks
    - A **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack** occurs when an attacker can intercept (and possibly change) communication between participants.

## Choice words

- "To design a cryptographic algorithm...is an easy task, but to design a _secure_ cryptographic algorithm is not for the faint of heart." (page 7)
