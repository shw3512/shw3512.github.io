# Hash functions

## Definitions

- A **(noncryptographic) hash function** is a function that satisfies the following properties:
    1. Arbitrary-length input
    2. Fixed-length output
    3. Deterministic
        - Same input always yields same output
- A **(cryptographic) hash function** is a noncryptographic hash function that satisfies the following additional properties:
    1. Second-preimage resistance
    2. Preimage resistance
        - This property makes it a **one-way function**
    4. Collision resistance
- The resistance properties of (cryptographic) hash functions are defined practically, not theoretically
    - Finding a preimage (or collision) should be computationally infeasible, not theoretically impossible
- The output of a noncryptographic hash function is called a **checksum** or **sum**.
- The output of a cryptographic hash function is called a **hash** or **digest**.
- In this book, Wong uses the term "hash function" to always mean "cryptographic hash function".
    - Henceforth, these notes will follow Wong's example.
- In practice, one typically designs hash functions to satisfy one additional property: unpredictable output.

Table. Security properties of (cryptographic) hash functions.

| Property                                    | Second preimage | Preimage | Collision |
|:--------------------------------------------|:---------------:|:--------:|:---------:|
| Digest fixed?                               |       yes       |    yes   |     no    |
| One (off-limits) element of preimage given? |       yes       |    no    |     no    |

### Warnings

- (!) Hash functions alone do not provide integrity
    - Underlying web of trust
        - The source of the digest
        - The mechanism used to communicate with the source of the digest
- (!) The resistance properties require that the domain (set of allowed inputs) and codomain (set of allowed outputs) be not too small
    - Effective minimum output length: 256 bits
