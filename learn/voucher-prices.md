# Cisco certification exam offers

In recent years, for a limited time once or twice a year, Cisco has offered a free retake with the purchase of an exam voucher for certain exams.

From 1 May 2025 to 12 June 2025, Pearson VUE ran a promotion [[1][1]] that offered a free retake for certain exams. The promotion worked as follows:

1. Visit the Pearson VUE promotion page [[1][1]] and opt-in to the eligible exam.
2. Schedule, pay for, and sit your exam during the promotion window.
3. If you don't pass your first exam, then use the promotion to retake the same exam for free from 7 July 2025 to 20 January 2026.

(Here are additional references [[3][3], [4][4], [5][5], [6][6]]. Here is the current version of the promotion page [[2][2]].)

Cisco offered a similar promotion [[7][7]] from 2 December 2024 to 31 December 2024, with a retake window from 1 January 2025 to 17 April 2025.

Cisco's Exam Safeguard voucher [[8][8]]---pay an additional 75 USD for your exam voucher to receive a free retake if you don't pass the first time---appears to be available year-round [[9][9]], except when Cisco temporarily suspends it in favor of a "free retake" promotion. (So if you were planning to buy an Exam Safeguard voucher, and don't see it on Cisco's page, see if Pearson VUE is offering a (better) promotion!)

The same page [[8][8]] gives information about Cisco's Exam Safeguard Plus bundle, which consists of an Exam Safeguard voucher and 90-day access to Cisco's practice tests for the corresponding exam.

Note that Cisco's Exam Safeguard and Exam Safeguard Plus options are both 90-day access: You must sit both the first exam and (if needed) the retake exam within 90 days of the purchase date [[10][10], [9][9]]. For this reason, people often recommend waiting to buy your exam voucher until a few weeks before you test [[9][9]]. (Presumably, people recommend a few weeks before and not the night before, because seats for the exam may not be available at your preferred testing center if you wait too close to your desired exam date to schedule the exam. That said, before you buy an exam voucher from Cisco, you can use the Pearson VUE website to check test availability at your preferred testing centers, then time your purchase of a voucher accordingly.)

At current prices (see Table 1 below), I consider the Exam Safeguard voucher a good deal (of course, it depends on your confidence and risk appetite), but the Exam Safeguard Plus option a bad one. In my opinion, if you want access to Cisco's practice exams, then it's better to pay an extra 4 USD to buy it separately from and earlier than the exam voucher. Buying it separately gives you 180-day access to the practice exams (twice as long as the 90-day access that comes with the Safeguard Plus bundle); buying it earlier than the exam voucher helps you study and gauge whether you're ready to sit the exam. Also, Cisco will occasionally discount study products like their practice exams---for example, during Cisco's annual Pi Day sale (March 14) [[11][11], [12][12]].
