## Resources

- Jeremy's IT Lab hosts a neat and well curated page of [recommended CCNA resources](https://www.jeremysitlab.com/ccna-resources)

### Books

- "[Understanding Cisco networking technologies]()" by Todd Lammle
- "[CCNA certification]()" by Todd Lammle
- "[Acing the CCNA exam](https://www.manning.com/books/acing-the-ccna-exam)" by Jeremy McDowell
    - I haven't used this book, but from what I can tell, it's essentially the content of the lecture videos in book form. I highly recommend the videos. If my preceding conjecture is correct, then I highly recommend the book. However, note that the book was written based on the exam topics for version 1.0 of the exam. Cisco has announced "[minor exam updates](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/ccna-v1-1-exam-topics)", going into effect on 20 August 2024. I would investigate whether corresponding minor book updates are planned, or plan to supplement the new areas with content (perhaps future video content from Jeremy himself).

### Online courses

- "[CCNA 200-301 complete course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ)" by Jeremy's IT Lab on YouTube
    - "A free and complete CCNA course". Includes lecture videos (with quizzes at the end of each), lab videos, and instructions for how to get (free) labs and flashcards.
    - The videos on YouTube have advertisements. The same content is available, ad-free but paywalled, from [Teachable](https://courses.jeremysitlab.com/p/ccna) and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-cisco-ccna-200-301-course/). See Jeremy's [comparison of the three options](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bqXS1nKNuIdumXjNXUoOINzUa704Og5jwUVyrvyauZs/edit).
