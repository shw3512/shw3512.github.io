\noindent{}Instructor's notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item BEFORE SOLVING any exercises, please go through the entire quiz and write a ``confidence number'' 1--5 to the LEFT of each exercise, denoting how confident you are that you can correctly solve the exercise (1 = ``Not at all confident'', 5 = ``Very confident''). Then, have fun solving!

\item Sections 1 and 2 review concepts you have engaged previously. Section 3 previews concepts we will engage this semester. While concepts in Section 3 may be novel to you (for now), I encourage you to try to say something insightful on these exercises, time permitting.

\item AFTER you are done working with this quiz, please scan or photograph your work and upload it to the Assignments page on Canvas, titled ``\href{https://canvas.rice.edu/courses/48326/assignments/236486}{Quiz : 2022\_01\_11}''.
