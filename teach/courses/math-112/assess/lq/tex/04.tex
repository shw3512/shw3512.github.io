Consider the function
\begin{align*}
f : [3,+\infty) \rightarrow \reals
&&
\text{given by}
&&
f(x)
=
\sqrt{x^{2} - 9}
\end{align*}
where as usual $\reals$ denotes ``all real numbers''. Find the derivative function $f'$. Be sure to specify its domain and codomain, in addition to the rule(s) of assignment.

\spaceSolution{4in}{% Begin solution.
The rule of assignment for $f$ involves a function within a function (namely, $x^{2} - 9$ within the square root function), so when differentiating $f$, we must use the chain rule. We compute
\begin{align*}
f'(x)
=
\frac{1}{2} \left(x^{2} - 9\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} (2 x)
=
\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^{2} - 9}}
\end{align*}
This rule of assignment is invalid for $x$ if and only if one of the following conditions holds:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The expression inside the square root is negative, i.e. $x^{2} - 9 < 0$. This happens if and only if $x^{2} < 9$, which happens if and only if $-3 < x < 3$, i.e. $x$ is in the open interval $(-3,3)$.
\item The denominator is zero. This happens if and only if $x = \pm{}3$.
\end{enumerate}
Combining these results, we conclude that the rule of assignment is invalid for all $x$ in the closed interval $[-3,3]$. Equivalently, the rule of assignment is valid for all $x$ outside this interval, i.e. in $(-\infty,-3) \cup (3,+\infty)$.

However, this last expression is not the domain of $f'$. Why not? We must also consider the domain of the original function $f$, which is $[3,+\infty)$. The domain of $f'$ is the set of points in the domain of the original function $f$ for which the rule of assignment for $f'$ is valid, i.e.
\begin{align*}
[3,+\infty) \cap \left((-\infty,-3) \cup (3,+\infty)\right)
=
(3,+\infty)
\end{align*}
where the symbol ``$\cap$'' means ``intersection'' (all the points in common). The codomain of $f'$ we may take to be all real numbers. Thus we conclude that the derivative function for the given $f$ is the function
\begin{align*}
f' : (3,+\infty) \rightarrow \reals
&&
\text{given by}
&&
f(x)
=
\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^{2} - 9}}
\end{align*}}% End solution.
