## Assessments

Remarks.

1. In the tables below, `q` links to a pdf of the exercises, `a` links to a pdf of proposed solutions, and `tex` links to source files (TeX and image files) called when compiling the pdfs.
    - If exactly one source file is called, then `tex` links to that TeX file.
    - If more than one source file is called, then `tex` links to a zip file that contains all source files.
3. To compile pdfs for the quizzes and exams, I used a common template TeX document ([`main.tex`](assess/main.tex)); and subdirectories named `sq`, `lq`, `rq`, `me`, and `ex` (in the same directory as `main.tex`), each with its own subdirectory named `tex`, in which the corresponding TeX files were saved.
    - Abbreviations: `sq` = short quiz, `lq` = long quiz, `rq` = requiz, `me` = mock exam, `ex` = exam
