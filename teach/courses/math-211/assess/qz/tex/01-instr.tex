\noindent{}Instructor's note:
\begin{itemize}
\item BEFORE SOLVING any exercises, go through the entire quiz and write a ``confidence number'' 1--5 to the LEFT of each exercise, denoting how confident you are that you can solve the exercise (1 = ``Not at all confident'', 5 = ``Very confident'').
\end{itemize}
