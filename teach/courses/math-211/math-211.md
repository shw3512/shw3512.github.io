### Lecture notes

All versions of the notes are compiled from the same files ([tex](/notes/tex/main.tex), [bib](/notes/tex/Bibliography.tex), and [zip](Graphics.zip)).

| Version                           | Shows solutions? | Shows suggested edits? |
|:----------------------------------|:----------------:|:----------------------:|
| [student](/notes/pdf/student.pdf) | no  | no  |
| [teacher](/notes/pdf/teacher.pdf) | yes | no  |
| [editor](/notes/pdf/editor.pdf)   | yes | yes |



## Assessments

Remarks.

1. In the tables below, `q` links to a pdf of the exercises, `a` links to a pdf of proposed solutions, `tex` links to the TeX document, and `zip` links to a zip file of images used in the assessment.
2. To compile pdfs for the quizzes and exams, I used a common template TeX document (named `main.tex`); and subdirectories named `qz` and `ex` (in the same directory as `main.tex`), each with its own subdirectory named `tex`, in which the corresponding TeX files were saved.
    - Abbreviations: `ex` = exam, `qz` = quiz
