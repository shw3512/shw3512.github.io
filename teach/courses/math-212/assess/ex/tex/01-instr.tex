\noindent{}Instructor's note:
\begin{itemize}
\item Manage your time deliberately.
\item An effort has been made to make the exercises as clear and unambiguous as possible. If the statement of an exercise seems unclear, briefly (one sentence) write your understanding of the exercise, then proceed.
\end{itemize}
