\noindent{}Instructor's note:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hints to each exercise are provided on the final page. Work through the entire exam prior to looking at the hints, then use the hints to help you with the challenging exercises.
\item Manage your time deliberately.
\item An effort has been made to make the exercises as clear and unambiguous as possible. If the statement of an exercise seems unclear, briefly (one sentence) write your understanding of the exercise, then proceed.
\end{itemize}
