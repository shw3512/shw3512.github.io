\section{Exercise}

(2 pt) Consider the function $f: \reals \rightarrow \reals$ given by
\begin{align*}
f(x)
=
2 x^{4}.
\end{align*}
State the level sets of $f$ with the values $-2$, $0$, and $2$. \fontHint{Sketch a graph of $f$. You may use the notation $LS_{f}(c)$ to denote the level set of $f$ with value $c$. You should state three such sets, corresponding to $c = -2,0,2$.}
