\section{Exercise}

(5 pt) Let $\fontVector{r}: \reals \rightarrow \reals^{3}$ be the position function of a particle. Prove that if the particle moves with constant speed, then its acceleration vector is orthogonal to its velocity vector at every point (i.e. at all times $t$). \fontHint{What is the definition of speed? If speed is constant, what about its square?}
