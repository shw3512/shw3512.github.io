(5 pt) Consider the unit sphere $S^{2}$ in $\reals^{3}$ centered at the origin. Find an equation for the tangent plane to $S^{2}$ at the point $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$. \fontHint{Recall that an equation for the unit sphere is
\begin{align*}
x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}
=
1.
\end{align*}
Solve for $z$ as a function of $x,y$, minding signs (!), then take partial derivatives. As an alternative to all this, think geometrically.}

\paragraph{Solution 1 (algebraic):}

Solving for $z$ as a function of $x,y$, we obtain
\begin{align}
z
=
\pm\sqrt{1 - x^{2} - y^{2}}.%
\label{eq: z(x,y)}
\end{align}
We are interested in the tangent plane at the point $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$, for which the $z$-coordinate is negative. Thus we take the negative square root in \eqref{eq: z(x,y)}. Computing the first-order partial derivatives of $z$ (note that we can use symmetry of $z$ in $x$ and $y$ to make just one computation), we find
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}
&=
\frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^{2} - y^{2}}},
&
\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}
&=
\frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - x^{2} - y^{2}}}.
\end{align*}
Evaluating these partial derivatives at the point $(x,y) = (\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ (again we can use symmetry in $x$ and $y$ to make just one computation), we have
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)
&=
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},
&
\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)
&=
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
\end{align*}
We conclude that an equation for the tangent plane to $S^{2}$ at the point $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$ is
\begin{align}
z - z_{0}
&=
\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)\right) \left(x - x_{0}\right) + \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)\right) \left(y - y_{0}\right)%
\nonumber
\\
z + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
&=
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \left(y - \frac{1}{2}\right).%
\label{eq: Equation Of Tangent Plane}
\end{align}



\paragraph{Solution 2 (geometric):}

Close your eyes and see the unit sphere (in fact, any sphere) in $\reals^{3}$ centered at the origin, and also see a tangent plane to this sphere, at any point $P_{0} = (x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ on the sphere. Note that any normal vector to this plane (positioned so that its initial point is at $P_{0}$) lies in the line containing the radius from the origin $O$ to $P_{0}$, i.e. is parallel to the vector
\begin{align*}
\fontVectorBetweenPoints{O P_{0}}
=
(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}).
\end{align*}
In particular, we can take the given point $P_{0}$ as the normal vector to the tangent plane. Doing so, we obtain the following equation for the tangent plane:
\begin{align*}
0
=
\left(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}\right) \cdot \left(x - x_{0},y - y_{0},z - z_{0}\right).
\end{align*}

In particular, an equation for the tangent plane to the unit sphere at the point $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$ is
\begin{align*}
0
=
\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \cdot \left(x - \frac{1}{2},y - \frac{1}{2},z + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)
=
\frac{1}{2} \left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2} \left(y - \frac{1}{2}\right) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(z + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right).
\end{align*}
Note that isolating the $z + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ term yields precisely equation \eqref{eq: Equation Of Tangent Plane}, found algebraically.
