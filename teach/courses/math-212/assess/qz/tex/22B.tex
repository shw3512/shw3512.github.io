\section{Exercise}

(5 pt) You have joined a cadre of mathematicians designing a lottery. The lottery works as follows: Two real numbers $X,Y$ are randomly chosen from the interval $[0,2]$ according to the probability density function $f: \reals^{2} \rightarrow \reals$ given by
\begin{align*}
f(x,y)
=
\begin{dcases*}
\frac{1}{8} x^{3} y	&	if $0 \leq x \leq 2,0 \leq y \leq 2$;	\\
0	&	otherwise.
\end{dcases*}
\end{align*}
If the product of $X$ and $Y$ is greater than $1$, then the person wins \$1 million. Otherwise, the person wins nothing.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item (1 pt) Sketch the relevant region of integration. Label relevant points of intersection.
\end{enumerate}

\spaceSolution{1.25in}{% Begin solution.
}% End solution.



\begin{enumerate}[resume,label=(\alph*)]
\item (2 pt) Set up an iterated (!) integral that gives the total probability that the person wins.
\end{enumerate}

\spaceSolution{.5in}{% Begin solution.
}% End solution.



\begin{enumerate}[resume,label=(\alph*)]
\item (1.5 pt) Show that the probability that the person wins is $\frac{225}{256} \approx .8789$. \fontHint{One order of integration may be easier than the other.}
\end{enumerate}

\spaceSolution{3in}{% Begin solution.
}% End solution.



\begin{enumerate}[resume,label=(\alph*)]
\item (0.5 pt) You want to expect to make money. What should you charge people to play this lottery?
\end{enumerate}

\spaceSolution{.25in}{% Begin solution.
}% End solution.
