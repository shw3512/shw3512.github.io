\noindent{}Let $K : K_{0}$ be a field extension, let $\alpha \in K$ be algebraic over $K_{0}$, and let $\sigma \in \Aut(K : K_{0})$. Characterize, as precisely and as fully as possible, the polynomials in $K_{0}[t]$ for which $\alpha$ or $\sigma(\alpha)$ is a zero.

\spaceSolution{3in}{% Begin solution.
By hypothesis, $\alpha \in K$ is algebraic over $K_{0}$, so there exists a (unique) minimal polynomial $m_{\alpha, K_{0}}$, which satisfies the three defining axioms:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item $m_{\alpha, K_{0}}(\alpha) = 0_{K}$ (view $m_{\alpha, K_{0}}$ as a function $K \rightarrow K$).
\item $m_{\alpha, K_{0}}$ is irreducible. (Equivalently, for all nonzero $f \in K_{0}[t]$ such that $f(\alpha) = 0_{K}$, $\deg m_{\alpha, K_{0}} \leq \deg f$.)
\item $\LC(m_{\alpha, K_{0}}) = 1_{K_{0}}$.
\end{enumerate}
Because $\sigma \in \Aut(K : K_{0})$ and $m_{\alpha, K_{0}} \in K_{0}[t]$, we have seen that
\begin{align*}
m_{\alpha, K_{0}}(\alpha)
&=
0_{K}
&
&\Leftrightarrow
&
m_{\alpha, K_{0}}(\sigma(\alpha))
&=
0_{K}
\end{align*}
It follows that $m_{\alpha, K_{0}}$ satisfies the three defining axioms to be the minimal polynomial for $\sigma(\alpha)$ over $K_{0}$, that is,
\begin{align*}
m_{\sigma(\alpha), K_{0}}
=
m_{\alpha, K_{0}}
\end{align*}
We have seen that if $f \in K_{0}[t]$ has an algebraic element as a zero, then $f$ is divisible by the minimal polynomial of that element over $K_{0}$. We conclude that the polynomials in $K_{0}[t]$ for which $\alpha$ is a zero are the same as those for which $\sigma(\alpha)$ is a zero, and they are precisely the polynomials in the ideal generated by $m_{\alpha, K_{0}}$ in $K_{0}[t]$.}% End solution.
